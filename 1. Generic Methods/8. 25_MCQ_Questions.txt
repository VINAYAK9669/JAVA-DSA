26) What are the disadvantages of generic programming in Java? (Select all that apply)
    a) Code verbosity: Generics can lead to increased code verbosity due to the need to specify type parameters.
    b) Runtime type erasure: Java's generics suffer from type erasure, which can lead to information loss at runtime.
    c) Limited support for primitive data types: Generics do not directly support primitive data types as type arguments.
    d) Inflexibility: Once a class is declared as generic, it cannot be used with different type parameters without recompilation.
    e) Code complexity: Generics can add complexity to the code, making it harder to understand for beginners.
